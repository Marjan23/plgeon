==Drop BIP Comments==

In theory, it's a nice idea, but in practice it seems to rarely be used, and just annoy BIP authors.

TODO: Talk to people apparently annoyed by them.

==Document process for adding BIP editors==

Historically, we've had a single BIP editor simply passing the torch to the next. It seems time to expand to multiple editors, and some explicit process for adding them should be specified.

==Cleanup auto-Rejection==

The timeout to Rejected status has become controversial. Perhaps split out a new status for BIPs not doing anything but not explicitly rejected?

==BIP versions==

A number of BIPs, including the BIP process itself, have found it better to just take the old BIP and revise it, rather than describing changes. It might be useful to have (eg) BIP 174v2 instead of an entirely new BIP number for PSBTv2.

==Markdown==

Lightning has created a parallel process called BOLT. My only guess is this is due to a preference for Markdown. If people want to use Markdown, let's restore it as an allowed format.

==Merge BOLTs==

Figure out what would be needed to merge BOLTs in so there isn't a separate specification repository/process.
