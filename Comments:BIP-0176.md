Comments for utilizing "bits" denomination.

I propose that "**bits**" should be written in lowercase to differentiate as much as possible between BTC and bits. 

Wallets and services do not immediately need to adopt "bits" as the default unit. 
Both "BTC" and "bits" could be displayed alongside each other in user interfaces for users to get accustomed to the new unit during a transitioning phase.
